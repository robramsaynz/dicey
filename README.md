# Dicey - A Diceword Passphrase Creator

Gibberish passphrases, made from words you already know, are a 
[very good thing](https://xkcd.com/936/). This program creates these

This program was created as a basic project to learn the Elixir
language, so the code is a bit rough and it's far from complete.
